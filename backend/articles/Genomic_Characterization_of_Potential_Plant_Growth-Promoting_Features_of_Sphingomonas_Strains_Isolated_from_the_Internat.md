## ABSTRACT

In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several _Sphingomonas_ strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as _Sphingomonas sanguinis_ (_n_ = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as _Sphingomonas paucimobilis_. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23 _Sphingomonas_ species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for _S. sanguinis_ in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS _S. sanguinis_ isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these _Sphingomonas_ strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.

**IMPORTANCE** _Sphingomonas_ is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the _Sphingomonas_ genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of _Sphingomonas_ members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future _in situ_ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS _Sphingomonas_ isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.

## INTRODUCTION

_Sphingomonas_ species are found in a variety of habitats, including soil, marine sediments, wastewater, and freshwater, in addition to the habitats contaminated with dyes, herbicides, and other pollutants ([1](#B1)[–](#B2)[3](#B3)). They possess diverse catabolic capabilities; for instance, assimilation of different types of complex sugars, including polysaccharides, was reported ([2](#B2)). Some species are tolerant to copper, resulting in biofilm formation and eventually surface corrosion ([4](#B4)), and some aid in herbicide mineralization or degradation of pollutants ([5](#B5)[–](#B6)[7](#B7)). _Sphingomonas paucimobilis_ has been isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) potable drinking water ([8](#B8)), ISS surfaces ([9](#B9)), and hospital clinical specimens and is known to cause rare infections in immunocompromised individuals ([2](#B2), [10](#B10), [11](#B11)).

Recent reports have identified the role of some _Sphingomonas_ species in plant growth promotion ([5](#B5), [12](#B12)[–](#B13)[14](#B14)). Microorganisms aid in plant growth promotion via different mechanisms, including secreting metabolites like phytohormones, solubilizing phosphate, fixating nitrogen, inducing stress response pathways, or acting as biocontrol agents ([5](#B5), [14](#B14)[–](#B15)[19](#B19)). Phytohormones play a significant role in plant metabolism and defense mechanisms ([20](#B20)). For instance, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is responsible for promoting cell division, elongation, and differentiation ([21](#B21)) and is involved in a wide range of plant processes ranging from responses to light and gravity to heavy metal stress tolerance ([22](#B22), [23](#B23)). Recent studies have detailed the role of _Sphingomonas_ species in plant growth promotion via the production of phytohormones and increased stress tolerance. _S. paucimobilis_ ZJSH1 produces phytohormones like IAA, salicylic acid, zeatin, and abscisic acid and helps in nitrogen fixation ([14](#B14)). _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11, isolated from the leaves of the arid medicinal plant _Tephrosia apollinea_, was shown to produce auxins and gibberellins and was reported to increase stress tolerance to salinity and cadmium in tomato plants ([12](#B12), [15](#B15), [24](#B24)). In addition, genomic analysis of _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 also revealed genes for hydrogen peroxide production that enhance plant growth, seed germination, and root colonization, genes for phosphate uptake, osmotic stress, and heavy metal stress ([15](#B15)). Genomic analysis of _Sphingomonas panacis_ DCY99T isolated from the roots of _Panax ginseng_ identified genes for IAA production, phosphate solubilization, heavy metal stress tolerance, and degradation of phenolic compounds ([5](#B5)). Furthermore, _Sphingomonas_ sp. Cra20 was shown to improve plant growth under drought stress conditions by altering the rhizosphere microbial community ([13](#B13)). The ability of microorganisms to produce phytohormones thus offers the potential to manipulate plant growth and development but without the need to supplement hormones externally to the plants.

In an ongoing microbial tracking experiment on the ISS, several microbial strains belonging to _Sphingomonas sanguinis_ (_n_ = 2) were isolated from the ISS, and a third strain identified as _S. paucimobilis_ was cultured from the Kennedy Space Center, Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF). After the isolation of _Sphingomonas_ strains from the ISS ([25](#B25), [26](#B26)), a complete genome (∼4.4 Mbp) was also assembled from the shotgun reads retrieved from the same ISS environmental surface ([26](#B26)), resulting in the production of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) belonging to _S. sanguinis_. Given the persistence of _Sphingomonas_ bacteria among spaceflight-relevant surfaces, and a growing body of evidence for _Sphingomonas_ strains to promote plant growth, this study applies comparative genomic analyses to identify genetic determinants that relate to plant growth-promoting features (PGPF) and highlights those that may be adaptive to growth on spaceflight-relevant environments and surfaces. Our findings report the presence of several determinants for the production of plant phytohormones, including several gene products promoting resistance to sources of abiotic stress, with emphasis on oxidative/osmotic stress resistance, heavy metal tolerance, and adaptation to sources of radiation. Further, the production of a phytohormone, IAA, by these isolates was confirmed using metabolomics. Moreover, intersection analysis of functional annotations and orthologous groups from the _Sphingomonas_ species from spaceflight-relevant surfaces (KSC-PHSF, ISS) revealed potential differences in gene contents involved in the horizontal gene transfer that are notably absent in their respective type strains. Taken together, our results show how characterization of microorganisms with respect to their ability to promote plant growth, including vegetables that can be used as a food source, will contribute to the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.

## RESULTS

### Abundance of _Sphingomonas_ species in the ISS.

Among the cultivable bacteria, three colonies obtained from ISS surfaces (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5) and one from KSC (FKI-L5-BR-P1) were identified as _Sphingomonas_ species. All ISS strains were _S. sanguinis_, and the KSC strain was _S. paucimobilis_. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and the draft genomes assembled were further used to confirm the identity of the species based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; [Table 1](#tab1)), which was calculated to be ∼99% with the nearest type strain. Genomic characteristics and other details of the annotation are given in [Table 1](#tab1). The metagenomic data analysis identified 23 _Sphingomonas_ species from flight 2, all of which were isolated from location 7, that is, a panel near the portable water dispenser (LAB) ([Fig. 1](#fig1)). In addition, the reads obtained from flight 1 belonging to a single species, _Sphingomonas_ _sanxanigenens_, were also seen in samples from flights 2 and 3 ([Fig. 1](#fig1)). However, its location on the ISS varied across different flights. Reads obtained from flight 3 also showed the presence of _S. paucimobilis_ from location 4, that is, the dining table (node 1). The metagenomic reads thus obtained from the ISS show that _Sphingomonas_ species persisted across all three flights, with _S. sanguinis_ being abundant among all _Sphingomonas_ species in flight 2. Furthermore, the MAG sequence (ISS-IIF7SWP) exhibited >99.6% ANI with the type strain of _S. sanguinis_ ([Table 1](#tab1)). The MAG was derived from the exact location on the ISS where _S. sanguinis_ isolates IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5 were retrieved using cultivation techniques. It was also confirmed that the MAG genome had >99% ANI value with the genomes of the _S. sanguinis_ strains isolated from the ISS. The use of the culture-dependent and -independent methods thus confirms the presence of _S. sanguinis_ on the ISS.

### Plant growth-promoting features in _Sphingomonas_ species isolated from spaceflight environments.

BLAST-based genome comparisons visualized using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across each spaceflight genome and their type strains compared against the _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 genome ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each _S. sanguinis_ (66.1 to 66.2%) and _S. paucimobilis_ (65.5%) genome were highly similar to that of LK11 (66.09%). Subsequent pangenome comparisons conducted by Anvi’o revealed a substantial core genome and further support both shared nucleotide and functional identity among these spaceflight _Sphingomonas_ genomes, their type strains, and the endophyte _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 ([Fig. 3](#fig3)).

Due to the high degree of functional identity shared between each of the space _Sphingomonas_ species and _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11, functional annotations for each of the spaceflight _Sphingomonas_ genomes and their type strains were conducted to identify putative PGPF. Functional analysis of these outputs revealed that many PGPFs proposed for _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 ([15](#B15)) are likely also present in the analyzed _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ genomes. Annotations reported from the EggNOGv5 database suggest that several gene products proposed to promote phosphate and sulfur assimilation in plants are also present in these select _Sphingomonas_ strains, albeit with some species-specific patterns. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake metabolism and solubilization in soil appear to be conserved across all the selected _S. paucimobilis_ and _S. sanguinis_ strains; however, gene products associated with sulfate/thiosulfate and hydrogen production may be exclusive to the selected _S. sanguinis_ strains. Furthermore, several pathways proposed to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including the heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be shared between these selected _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ genomes.

Previous reports suggested that responses to oxidative stress in _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 may promote plant host tolerance to abiotic stress via the amelioration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ([12](#B12), [15](#B15), [27](#B27)). Therefore, specific gene products related to oxidative stress resistance in space-associated _Sphingomonas_ strains were further identified. Analysis of annotations generated by PGAP and eggNOG-MapperV2 suggested that space-associated _Sphingomonas_ strains harbor multiple copies of several classes of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, and glutaredoxins. Next, we sought to identify metabolic pathways suggested to reduce the abundance of ROS, for instance, carotenoids, which are known for their antioxidant activity ([28](#B28)). Examination of PGAP and eggNOG annotations suggest that all _Sphingomonas_ strains analyzed in this study possess the genetic repertoire (_crtB_, _crtI_, _crtY_, _crtZ_) to produce the carotenoid zeaxanthin from the precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) ([Fig. 4A](#fig4)). Further analysis also revealed the presence of an unnamed sterol desaturase family protein, often proximate to these gene clusters, which shared high identity to the _crtG_ gene product identified in _Sphingomonas elodea_ ATCC 31461 (74% to 75% identity) ([29](#B29)). _CrtG_ converts zeaxanthin to produce the yellow pigment nostoxanthin, a common carotenoid produced by _Sphingomonas_ ([30](#B30)). Likewise, two pathways for the production of the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose were also identified in both the _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ strains. Trehalose serves a variety of functions across organisms, acting as a carbon source, a compatible solute, and a metabolite that provides protection against a variety of abiotic stressors ([31](#B31)). These results suggest that _Sphingomonas_ strains can potentially synthesize trehalose from the _otsA/B_ pathway, wherein a two-step mechanism catalyzes the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate from the condensation of glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose residues (_otsA_) and subsequent dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate into the disaccharide trehalose (_otsB_). Additionally, trehalose could also be produced in these bacteria through catabolism of α(1,4) glucose polymers into trehalose via the _treY/Z_ pathway ([Fig. 4B](#fig4)).

These findings suggest that the tested _Sphingomonas_ species, including the strains sequenced from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, contain several pathways likely to confer resistance to a variety of abiotic stressors, especially with respect to several antioxidant enzymes and metabolites. The presence of these features supports the potential role of these newly sequenced _Sphingomonas_ strains to promote plant growth and increase plant stress tolerance.

### Indole-3-acetic acid production by _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ strains isolated from the ISS.

One of the sources of IAA biosynthesis is the amino acid tryptophan, and analysis of the orthologous groups identified by the eggNOGv5 database suggested that the selected _Sphingomonas_ strains possess the required tryptophan biosynthesis genes (_trpA_,_B_,_C_,_D_,_E_,_F_), consistent with observations from previous reports in the literature ([5](#B5), [15](#B15)). Leveraging the inclusion of several KEGG orthologs, enzyme classes, and KEGG reactions outputs via eggNOG-MapperV2, potential pathways for these _Sphingomonas_ to synthesize IAA from tryptophan are proposed ([Fig. 4C](#fig4)). Analysis of the functional annotations transferred from the EggNOGv5 database pointed to a group of carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family proteins that may act as putative nitrilases (E.C 3.5.5.1), converting indole-3-acetonitrile directly to IAA. Similarly, each of the analyzed _Sphingomonas_ strains harbors a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase (putative monoamine oxidase EC 1.4.3.4), which likely promotes the conversion of tryptamine into indole-3-acetaldehyde. However, subsequent steps allowing the conversion of indole-3-acetaldehyde to IAA via an unnamed aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein (EC 1.2.1.3) were exclusive to the analyzed _S. paucimobilis_ genomes. Further, the presence of indole-pyruvate ferredoxin, an enzyme which is responsible for the conversion of indole-3-pyruvate into S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), was also exclusive to _S. paucimobilis_; however, it is unclear as to how _S. paucimobilis_ may further alter S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl-CoA into IAA. While two putative mechanisms across both _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ that may directly yield IAA from tryptophan-derived metabolites are supported by the results of functional annotation, we failed to identify canonical mechanisms for the formation of the upstream reactants in tryptophan metabolism, suggesting that novel mechanisms for IAA formation may occur in _Sphingomonas_ and species-dependent pathways may supplement a shared metabolic pathway. Interestingly, while an auxin export carrier family protein was identified in each of the analyzed _S. paucimobilis_ genomes, no such protein was identified in _S. sanguinis_.

Since the genomic analysis of the spaceflight isolates revealed genetic signatures for the production of several plant growth-promoting hormones, metabolomic characterization was carried out to identify the phytohormone IAA. All _Sphingomonas_ isolates obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces were cultured in the presence of tryptophan, and metabolites extracted from the culture filtrate were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). The MS data analysis showed the presence of IAA among the metabolites extracted from all three strains, _S. sanguinis_ IIF7SW-B3A, _S. sanguinis_ IIF7SW-B5, and _S. paucimobilis_ FKI-L5-BR-P1 ([Fig. 5A](#fig5)). The production of IAA (molecular weight, M = 175.18 g/mol) by these isolates was confirmed by comparing the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) profile (positive mode: M+H = ∼176 g/mol) of IAA standard with culture extracts, either alone or mixed with IAA standard ([Fig. 5A](#fig5)). The ESI-MS profile of all the three culture extracts was found to be comparable with the standard. Further, the production of IAA was validated by tandem mass spectrometry to generate a mass fragmentation profile in positive mode, corresponding to M+H of ∼176 g/mol. The three culture extracts resulted in a fragmentation pattern that was similar to the IAA standard, generating three different fragments, including a parent ion of ∼176 g/mol ([Fig. 5B](#fig5)). In contrast, the presence of IAA was not observed in nutrient media without tryptophan (data not shown). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data also revealed the presence of few other metabolites with molecular weights similar to those of other phytohormones; however, their positive identification will require further analysis, which is outside the scope of this study.

### Functional differences between ISS _Sphingomonas_ isolates and their type strains.

Analysis of plant growth-promoting features suggested the potential for conserved functional characteristics between the spaceflight and type strains of _S. paucimobilis_ and _S. sanguinis_ genomes but with some distinctions. Therefore, functional differences were further explored through hierarchical clustering of the relative abundance of functional categories assigned by the eggNOG database ([Fig. 6](#fig6)). Intriguingly, the selected _Sphingomonas_ genomes clustered primarily according to the environment in which they were sampled (terrestrial type strains versus spaceflight-relevant surfaces at KSC and the ISS) and then clustered according to their species assignment. Examining the relative abundance of each of the assigned functional categories, it is clear that a sizeable portion (∼20% to 21%) of each of these selected _Sphingomonas_ genomes lack known functional roles, highlighting novel gene products that are ripe for future bioinformatics and molecular characterization. Yet, differences in functional products corresponding to the category L, replication, recombination, and repair, are noticeably higher in genomes of the strains isolated from spaceflight-relevant surfaces.

Protein-level differences between the _Sphingomonas_ strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains are shown in [Fig. 7A](#fig7) and Table S1. Intersection analysis was performed using UpsetR for the presence and absence of named protein products across each genome ([Fig. 7B](#fig7)). Here, 1,488 named proteins were shared among all of the selected spaceflight-relevant _Sphingomonas_ genomes and their respective type strains. In contrast, 71 named orthologous proteins were unique to the _S. paucimobilis_ strains isolated from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, and an analogous 53 named orthologous proteins were found to be unique to _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight strains. However, a sizable portion of the proteomes for each of these genomes lacked predicted protein names to use as unique terms for intersection analysis. Thus, a custom pileup was performed that grouped entries into unique keys consisting of common predicted taxa, predicted protein names, the eggNOG free text description, and their predicted functional category where unnamed proteins could be compared across multiple genomes. While this method enhanced comparisons of unnamed protein groups identified by eggNOGv5, precaution should be taken when comparing the results, as different seed orthologs appear to transfer slightly different descriptions; however, such an analysis greatly improved functional insights that would not have been captured via analysis of KEGG Orthology (KO) or named proteins alone. Analysis of the KO assigned by eggNOGv5 revealed that gene clusters associated with rhamnose metabolism, type IV secretion (_trb_ operon), conjugal transfer pilus assembly proteins (_tra_ operon), and heavy metal resistance genes are present in each of the spaceflight _S. sanguinis_ strains and are notably absent from the type strain _S. sanguinis_ NBRC 13937T. While _S. sanguinis_ NBRC 13937T is not a complete genome, the ability to capture the presence or components of large biosynthetic clusters or operons is conducive to the assemblies’ _N_50 of 61,922 bp across 134 contigs of total length 4,053,092 bp. Similar patterns of differences in type IV secretion apparatus, conjugal transfer proteins, and rhamnose metabolism were also observed for the spaceflight-relevant surface strains from _S. paucimobilis_ compared to those of their type strains, albeit to a lesser extent than the patterns reported for _S. sanguinis_. Further unique gene products identified in _S. paucimobilis_ include a suite of multidrug efflux proteins, DNA repair proteins (_dinJ_ and _sbcD_), catechol metabolism (_catABC_), genes involved in quorum sensing via homoserine lactone synthesis and export, and the natural transformation protein _comEA_. Both _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ spaceflight isolates also showed the presence of genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of industrially important metabolites, including antibiotics (erythromycin and vancomycin) and anticancer compounds (betalains). Overall, our results point to functional differences in these spaceflight-relevant _S. paucimobilis_ and _S. sanguinis_ genomes compared to their respective type strains, many of which may provide adaptive advantages for survival during spaceflight or on spaceflight-relevant surfaces.

## DISCUSSION

This study shows the identification of putative PGPFs in _Sphingomonas_ strains isolated from the ISS or in a cleanroom where spacecraft are assembled. The features involved in the plant growth promotion were identified based on comparative genomic analysis with a well-characterized endophyte _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11. Such comparative genomic analysis of the _S. sanguinis_ IIF7SW-B3A, _S. sanguinis_ IIF7SW-B5, _S. sanguinis_ ISS-IIF7SWP, and _S. paucimobilis_ FKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceflight genomes, along with their respective type strains, showed substantial genomic similarity to _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11, evidenced by high nucleotide identity and a large core genome shared among these bacteria. Leveraging extensive annotation provided by the eggNOG-MapperV2 software, PGPFs described previously for _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 ([14](#B14)) were largely consistent with the results of comparative analysis conducted in this study. While minor species-specific differences in sulfur assimilation and hydrogen sulfide production were identified in _S. sanguinis_, all genomes shared similar putative PGPFs. Specifically, genomic analysis highlighted the presence of several enzyme classes that participate in ROS metabolism which appear to be present in multiple copies across each of the selected _Sphingomonas_ genomes.

In addition, analysis of metabolic pathways of spaceflight _Sphingomonas_ strains also suggested that each strain is likely capable of producing the carotenoids zeaxanthin and nostoxanthin. Zeaxanthin has been suggested to play a number of roles in both bacteria and plants, including photoprotection, detoxification of ROS, and resistance to ionizing radiation ([32](#B32)). Indeed, high levels of zeaxanthin production in the bacterium _Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens_ were shown to promote resistance to ionizing, UV radiation, and hydrogen peroxide; however, resistance among the select _Sphingomonas_ strains was weaker than that among _P. zeaxanthinifaciens_ ([33](#B33)). Additionally, zeaxanthin also serves as a metabolic precursor for the formation of the plant phytohormone abscisic acid, prompting speculation that zeaxanthin-producing, plant-associated microbes may promote plant growth by supplying plant hosts with carotenoid derivatives such as zeaxanthin ([34](#B34)).

Further evidence for producing plant-relevant metabolites that confer antioxidant activity was also supported by the identification of the _otsA/B_ and _treY/Z_ pathways in each of the spaceflight _Sphingomonas_ strains, strongly suggesting that these bacteria produce the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose. These results are in agreement with the identification of the _otsA/B_ and _treY/Z_ pathways in _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 ([15](#B15)), as well as with previous work demonstrating that soybean plants inoculated with _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11, with and without exogenous trehalose, improved plant growth and stress tolerance under drought stress conditions induced via polyethylene glycol treatment ([27](#B27)). Likewise, transgenic introduction of the _Escherichia coli_ _otsA/B_ pathway in rice plant recipients yielded enhanced plant resistance to abiotic stress ([35](#B35)). In addition to promoting abiotic stress resistance in plants, trehalose production likely serves as an antioxidant against oxidative stress in microbes, conferring resistance to hydrogen peroxide, and oxidative damage to proteins and lipids induced by ROS ([36](#B36), [37](#B37)). Due to its role as both an antioxidant and signaling molecule, trehalose production also elicits protective effects against sources of ionizing radiation ([38](#B38)[–](#B39)[40](#B40)).

Overall, these results strongly suggest that gene products identified across these spaceflight _Sphingomonas_ strains support a model proposed for _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 (a strain isolated from a desert plant), wherein excessive ROS produced by plant hosts is ameliorated through oxidative stress response pathways deployed by _Sphingomonas_ strains, thereby increasing plant stress tolerance to abiotic environments ([15](#B15)). In addition, many of these ROS-metabolizing gene products discussed in the context of plant abiotic stress also contribute to increased resistance against ionizing radiation. Given evidence of oxidative stress responses deployed by microbial systems during spaceflight ([41](#B41)), and increased exposure to sources of ionizing radiation in extraterrestrial environments, we speculate that many of the discussed PGPFs likely present in spaceflight _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ strains may be advantageous to their survival in the spaceflight environment.

Alongside several putative PGPFs, the genomic analysis suggested that IAA may be produced through three separate pathways in these organisms, albeit with some species-specific reactions. While all the space _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ strains shared annotations for the conversion of indole-3-acetonitrile into IAA via a putative nitrilase enzyme, the production of IAA from the oxidation of indole-3-acetaldehyde via an unnamed aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein was absent in the spaceflight _S. sanguinis_ strains. Yet, all _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ strains may also produce indole-3-acetaldehyde from tryptamine, catalyzed by a monoamine oxidase enzyme. While functional analyses have proposed putative downstream reaction mechanisms to produce IAA, many of the upstream reaction pathways lack a well-characterized mechanism of action via known gene products or enzyme classes. Consistent with this study, not all genes involved in IAA biosynthesis were found in the genomes of _S. panacis_ DCY99T and _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 ([5](#B5), [15](#B15)), indicating that a novel pathway for IAA production in _Sphingomonas_ strains is yet to be elucidated. Subsequent LC-MS analysis confirmed that each of the space _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ isolates produced IAA, however, only when their growth medium was supplemented with tryptophan. The results obtained agree with other studies that have reported the production of IAA in _Sphingomonas_ strains but, again, only in the presence of tryptophan in growth media ([5](#B5), [12](#B12)). In addition to the role of zeaxanthin and other plant metabolites in providing tolerance to certain stress conditions, IAA has also been reported to regulate several stress-related genes in _Escherichia coli_ via accumulation of DnaK chaperone and trehalose ([42](#B42)). Some other studies have also reported an increase in trehalose accumulation upon exposure to IAA and found those cells to be more resistant to cold shock ([43](#B43), [44](#B44)). The chaperone DnaK has also been shown to protect _E. coli_ from oxidative damage by preventing protein aggregation ([45](#B45)). This observation indicates that the production of IAA by space _Sphingomonas_ strains might indirectly contribute to stress tolerance in the associated plants via similar mechanisms. Future applications of metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses under space or simulated microgravity conditions will likely be prudent for identifying patterns of metabolic flux in response to tryptophan supplementation, thereby elucidating potential mechanisms for IAA production in these bacteria.

Prompted by differences in functional compositions between _Sphingomonas_ strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces (KSC, ISS, Shengzhou Rocket X), intersectional analysis of orthologous groups of spaceflight-relevant genomes against their type strains was performed. Analysis of KEGG-associated annotations provided by eggNOGv5 showed the presence of several genes in space-related _Sphingomonas_ isolates that were not otherwise found in their respective type strains. _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight isolates showed the presence of _tra_ genes involved in pilus assembly and conjugal transfer (_traF_, _trbC_, _traU_, _traW_, _trbI_, _traC_, _traV_, _traB_, _traK_, _traE_, _traL_, and _traH_) and those involved in mating pair stabilization (_traG_ and _traN_), which were absent in the type strain ([46](#B46)). Some groups have previously reported the occurrence of conjugal transfer in bacteria under microgravity conditions ([47](#B47)[–](#B48)[49](#B49)). Therefore, the presence of _tra_ genes in _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight isolates indicates the existence of conjugal transfer under space conditions that might also be responsible for acquiring genetic materials from related bacterial species.

In addition, _S. paucimobilis_ FKI-L5-BR-P1 showed the presence of genes involved in quorum sensing: _lasI_ (acyl-homoserine lactone synthase), acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) biosynthesis, and LuxR family transcriptional regulator. AHLs act as signaling molecules through which LuxR regulates the expression of a number of genes, some of which are potentially associated with virulence ([50](#B50)). AntiSMASH analysis of _S. paucimobilis_ FKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceflight isolate also showed the presence of a gene cluster (region 6.1; Fig. S1) involved in the synthesis of a homoserine lactone (Hserlactone).

Further, KEGG analysis also showed the presence of some genes involved in the production of industrially important metabolites in the spaceflight isolates. For instance, both _S. sanguinis_ and _S. paucimobilis_ spaceflight isolates showed the presence of modules associated with the biosynthesis of antibiotics like erythromycin A/B and vancomycin, which were absent in the type strains. Another important pathway that was highlighted in these spaceflight isolates is the betalain biosynthesis pathway and the presence of gene 4,5-DOPA dioxygenase extradiol. The enzyme dioxygenase extradiol is involved in opening the cyclic ring of dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA), resulting in the formation of an unstable seco-DOPA that further rearranges to form betalamic acid, the structural unit of betalains ([51](#B51)). Betalains are known to be majorly produced by _Caryophyllales_ plants (e.g., the red and yellow pigments found in beets) and some fungal species; however, one bacterial species, _Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus_, was recently reported to produce betalains ([52](#B52)). They are known to have antioxidant activity, are reported to be effective against some cancer cells, and also promote anti-inflammatory response ([53](#B53)[–](#B54)[55](#B55)).

In addition, KEGG Orthology analysis indicated the presence of some genes in _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight isolates that may have been acquired to help them survive the use of antibiotics, as noted by multiple studies of other microbial species on the ISS ([26](#B26), [56](#B56)[–](#B57)[59](#B59)). For instance, the mercury resistance operon present in some bacteria contains mostly three genes: _merR_ (transcriptional regulator), _merT_ (inner membrane mercury scavenging protein), and _merP_ (periplasmic mercury scavenging protein) ([60](#B60)), which were also found in _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight and type strains. In addition to these three genes, the spaceflight-relevant isolates also showed the presence of _merB_ (alkylmercury lyase), _merE_ (mercuric ion transport protein), and _merD_ (MerR family transcriptional regulator, mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein), which are not present in all bacteria containing the operon. Previous studies have reported that several _mer_ genes (_merD_ and _merE_) were more likely to be encoded on plasmids or transposons and, therefore, can be transferred via horizontal gene transfer ([61](#B61)), which might also be the case for _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight isolates. _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight isolates also contained gene _rcnA_, belonging to nickel/cobalt transporter family protein.

### Conclusions.

This study utilized comparative genomics and identified a plethora of factors in _Sphingomonas_ present in spaceflight environments that may result in the production of several PGPFs and aid in the growth of plants. The production of one of the phytohormones IAA was also confirmed using metabolomics. These space _Sphingomonas_ strains, along with other plant growth-promoting strains of microbes isolated from the ISS ([62](#B62)), therefore, hold great potential to contribute to space exploration through promoting and controlling plant growth as part of an integrated bio-regenerative life support system enabling future extended-duration crewed missions.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Sample collection and whole-genome sequence analysis.

Sample collection and processing, followed by WGS and assembly that led to the isolation of _Sphingomonas_ strains, are described elsewhere ([25](#B25), [63](#B63)). Samples collected across different locations on the ISS, and the KSC-PHSF cleanroom, were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) to culture different bacterial colonies ([25](#B25)). In addition to cultivation, previously published metagenomic sequences sampled from ISS locations were downloaded from NCBI ([26](#B26)) and analyzed for the presence of _Sphingomonas_ species, and MAGs were generated.

DNA extraction was followed by metagenomic sequencing and assembly as described previously ([26](#B26)). Identification of _Sphingomonas_ spp. from metagenomic assembly was performed as described elsewhere ([59](#B59)). In the case of _S. sanguinis_ genome assembled from the metagenome, sample collection, processing, and DNA extraction were carried out as reported previously ([26](#B26)). The assembled draft genomes were annotated using NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) 4.11 ([64](#B64), [65](#B65)). The identity of the strains was confirmed based on ANI calculated using EZBioCloud ([66](#B66)).

### Genome annotation.

To further explore potential functional differences between spaceflight isolates and their respective type strains, we obtained coding sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database and, where applicable, performed additional annotation through the online eggNOG-mapperV2 web server using the default settings ([67](#B67), [68](#B68)). The coding sequences of the metagenome-assembled genome of _S. sanguinis_ ISS-IIF7SWP were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. Coding nucleotide sequences for each _Sphingomonas_ genome along with their respective type strains were annotated using the online eggNOG-MapperV2 software, whose column-based outputs were parsed and compared on a per-genome basis using a custom python script (available for use via [https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook](https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook)). Preliminary annotations of these select spaceflight isolates highlighted potential connections to the plant endophyte _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11, a strain well characterized with respect to its plant growth-promoting capabilities ([12](#B12), [15](#B15), [24](#B24), [27](#B27), [69](#B69)). Given the presence of a thoroughly annotated and complete genome sequence ([15](#B15)), robust evidence for the production of the plant phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA) and IAA ([12](#B12), [15](#B15)), and previous use as a model for novel plant-associated _Sphingomonas_ genomes ([5](#B5)), _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 was selected as a reference genome to identify putative plant growth-promoting features in other _Sphingomonas_ genomes. In this study, the endophyte _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11, two _S. sanguinis_ isolates (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5), and one _S. sanguinis_ MAG (ISS-IIF7SWP) sampled from the ISS, _S. paucimobilis_ FKI-L5-BR-P1 cultured from KSC-PHSF, and _S. paucimobilis_ LCT-SP1 isolated from the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou X were compared against their respective type strains: _S. sanguinis_ NBRC 13937T and _S. paucimobilis_ NCTC 11030T.

### Metabolite extraction and analysis.

Previous reports have characterized the phytohormone production capability of several _Sphingomonas_ species, including _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 ([11](#B11)), _S. panacis_ DCY99T ([5](#B5)), and _S. paucimobilis ZJSH1_ ([14](#B14)). While both _S. paucimobilis_ ZJSH1 and _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 were confirmed to produce the plant phytohormone IAA, the definitive chemical pathway responsible for their production is yet to be elucidated ([12](#B12), [14](#B14), [15](#B15)). Therefore, the potential for the production of the auxin-derivative IAA in each of the selected _S. paucimobilis_ and _S. sanguinis_ strains was examined. The space isolates (_S. sanguinis_ IIF7SW-B3A, _S. sanguinis_ IIF7SW-B5, and _S. paucimobilis_ FKI-L5-BR-P1) were streaked on R2A (Difco, USA) and incubated at 28°C for 5 days. The strains were then inoculated in nutrient broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) containing 3 g/L l\-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 28°C, 180 rpm for 7 days. To examine the phytohormones produced and secreted in culture filtrate, we pelleted the cells and extracted the metabolites from the supernatant using ethyl acetate. This step was repeated twice. The culture supernatant was then acidified using 6N HCl and metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer after each step described above was transferred to a fresh tube and evaporated in TurboVap LV. The residue obtained after drying the solvent was resuspended in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/95% (vol/vol) methanol at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. A suitable aliquot of the extract (10 μL) was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis.

Stock solution of IAA standard (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was prepared in 5% DMSO/95% methanol (vol/vol) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. It was diluted 10 times, and 10 μL of the dilution was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. HPLC-DAD-MS was carried out using Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C18 column (Alltech Prevail C18 3 mm 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate of 125 μL/min. The solvent gradient for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was 95% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (MeCN)/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (vol/vol; solvent A), both containing 0.05% (vol/vol) formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 30 min, 100% solvent B from 30 to 45 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 45 to 45.10 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45.10 to 50 min.

### Comparative functional analysis.

Genome similarities between spaceflight _Sphingomonas_ strains, their respective type strains, and the plant endophyte _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 were visualized using BRIG version 0.95 with the _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 (chromosome and plasmids) assigned as the reference genome ([70](#B70)). Percent identity values for space isolates and corresponding type strains were calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%).

To address potential functional differences between space isolates and their corresponding type strains, custom Python and R scripts ([https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook](https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook)) were designed to parse output annotation tables and summarize their features on a per-genome basis. Descriptions for select KEGG IDs identified in eggNOG-MapperV2 were assigned using the BioServices API ([71](#B71)). To identify protein-level differences between the _Sphingomonas_ strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains, custom python scripts were created to construct pileup gene count tables for the annotations generated from the EggNOG-MapperV2 software. Genes identified by eggNOG-MapperV2 for the _S. paucimobilis_ and _S. sanguinis_ spaceflight isolates were pooled on a species basis and then compared to their type strains using JVENN ([72](#B72)) and UpSetR ([73](#B73)) using intersection analyses. Output tables generated by these analyses are displayed in Table S1.

### Pangenome analysis.

Pangenome analysis of the _Sphingomonas_ space isolates, their type strains, and the plant endophyte _Sphingomonas_ sp. LK11 was performed using Anvi’o v6.2 ([74](#B74)[–](#B75)[76](#B76)). Primary functional annotation in the Anvi’o software was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (**–**num-threads 2, **–**mcl-inflation 6, **–**min-bit 0.5, **–**use-ncbi-blast). The ordering of the pangenome display was determined using Euclidean distances and ward linkage settings.
