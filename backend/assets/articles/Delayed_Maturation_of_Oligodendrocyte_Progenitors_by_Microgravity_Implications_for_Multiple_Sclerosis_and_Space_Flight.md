## Error in Figure

The authors wish to make the following corrections to Figure 10 of this paper \[[1](#B1-life-13-02051)\]:

In the original publication, there is a mistake in the bar graph of Figure 10 as published.

At the moment of uploading the manuscript, we chose the wrong legend version. It should say Tf for transferrin (instead of Fer for ferritin, as published). The figure as is makes no sense because this section is about the two specific markers Tf and GPDH. Swapping the figure will correct the information without altering the data, contents or caption. The text and caption for the entire figure discuss transferrin (Tf) and the correct graph is pasted below.

The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.
